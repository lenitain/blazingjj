/*! Background execution of jj commands.

Each task gets a thread that blocks until its command is done and then
sends the result into the [AppEvent] channel the main loop waits on, so
no caller ever blocks on a jj invocation or has to ask whether one is
finished.

A task is identified by a [TaskSlot]. The slot is both the deduplication
key -- submitting work that is already in flight is a no-op -- and the
label that lets the consumer recognize what it gets back.
